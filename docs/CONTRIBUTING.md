## Getting started <!-- omit in toc -->

Before you begin:
- Have you read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?
- Check out the [existing issues](https://github.com/TadPath/PUMA/issues) 


## Funding
No funding or metarial compensation is available for contributors to this site. If you contribute you do so on the understanding and agreement that you are giving of your time and expertise free of charge and without the expectation or entitlement to monetary or other material compensation.
For the avoidance of doubt, any links to Patreon and PayPal donatation sites are for voluntary contributions to Dr Paul J. Tadrous to assist in his costs for creating and maintaining not only this GitHub project but his other teaching, research and educational activities across other websites including YouTube and OptArc.

## Language

All documentation and source code comments are to be written using UK / British English and spellings.

## Computer code

Please keep to the coding and comment style used in the original source files.
Please ensure alignment of any comment delimiters is preserved after editing any comments
The preferred language is C or Python. Other acceptable languages are those that may be compiled with open source compilation tools such as gcc, g++ or similar.
Java and Java script are not permitted.
Any scripting language embedded in Microsoft Word, Excel or other MS Office product will not be allowed as part of the PUMA open source standard.

## Hardware

The general rules for anyone wanting to contribute hardware specs, corrections, new modules design and methods are:
* Only complete CAD files readable with FreeCAD are accepted which include the editable models but NOT meshes.
* STL and 3MF (or other mesh-type) files are not permitted.
* The models must be 3D printable on a low-to-medium end FDM 3D printer (such as the Creality Ender 3).
* Any post processing required to assemble or fit the part must not use specialist tools beyond those commonly and cheaply available to most people without specialist machine working skills. In particular only the following items are acceptable: Craft knife (like a Stanley knife), hand held tools like screwdriver, spanner, hammer, hand-held electric drill and common houshold objects like a coin or aluminium foil.
* Any design requiring specialist power tools such as a pillar drill, a lathe, a CNC router, etc. will not be acceptable.
* Any non-printed items must be easily available from multiple suppliers e.g. on AliExpress, eBay, Amazon or a general hardware store.
* No module requiring special one-off components - even if available from the above-mentioned stores - shall be acceptable. By 'special one-off' I mean such things as specially made modules designed to fit in products that are no longer sold (end of line). An example would be a particular brand of LCD projector or the motorisation assembly for a particular camera focus mechanism. Such things may be bought cheaply and provide excellent functionality but they do not pass the test of longevity and generic availability. If PUMA were to use such modules for  it's parts, those parts have an undue risk of becoming obsolete.
* Hardware modules designed to interface to vendor-specific hardware may be considered if generic adaptor editability is built into the module CAD design. For example a generic smartphone eyepiece adapter module with an add-on part that allows any one of a range of vendor specific smartphones to be used would be fine.
* A detailed instruction guide must accompany any submission including for both the construction and use of hardware. This must include details of 3D printing settings such as orientation on the print bed and any printer profiles. This must also include sufficient detail of construction to allow the module to be built from scratch and any post build adjustments / alignment / fitting to the scope to be done. This may be in written form (preferably with illustrations) or as a video tutorial. If the contributor posts a video tutotial on YouTube (other platforms may also be used but a YouTube posting must also exist and be maintained). The contributor must agree (and be in a position to agree) that a backup copy of their video be stored offline and permit re-upload to another YouTube channel in the event that their own YouTube channel be taken down at some point in the future. All submitted documentation must be subject to the same open documentation license as the rest of the PUMA project and the contributor must agree to this and have the necessary intellectual property permissions for all text and illustrations and video to allow them to agree to this without breech of either their own or any third party's intellectual property rights.

Of course there is nothing to stop anyone using any of the above to make their own customisations for their own needs or forks of PUMA. However these are the rules for anyone wanting to contribule their model as part of the official PUMA open source standard package.

## Electronics
* Use of Arduino and Raspberry Pi-based solutions are welcome provided any additional interface board conforms tot he following:
  * It is already widely commercially available from common stores such as those mentioned above.
  * If not already widely available it can be made with moderate ease using tripad or veroboard strip pads (pre-drilled copper-clad boards).
  * Any interface or additional PCB required which can be made from the above pre-drilled boards may also have a custom PCB version submitted provided that custom PCB and the self-built pre-drilled boards are cross compatible in terms of all functionality and physical fit to a 3D printed enclosure.
  * Any custom PCB that does not conform to the above will not be acceptable as part of the PUMA standard.
  * All components used must be easily available from stores such as RS, Farnell CPC, Element 14 or AliExpress.
  * All electronics must be supplied with full details of components and construction.
  * Any enclosure must be 3D printable and the full CAD files supplied and subject to the rules mentioned above for Hardware.
  * Any electronics must also have a detailed end user guide submitted as well in order to be acceptable as part of the open source PUMA standard.
  * All associated software must also be submitted in open source GPL v3 to be compatible with the license of the PUMA project.

## Images, Design Files, Patents, Copyright and Other Intellectual Property Matters
Patented work is not acceptable as a submission to the PUMA project unless the patent or patents have lapsed and cannot be renewed and / or the patent owner(s) grant unlimited and free permission for the work to be used and distributed as a GPL (v3 or later) project. Any images, design files, music, logos or other content subject to design rights and copyright used in any contribution, regardless of type, must have copyright or other intellectual property rights owned by the contributor(s) and all those contributors agree that their intellectual property may be freely used as part of the PUMA project licensed under GPL (v3 or later). If any intellectual property rights are not owned by the contributor then the owner of those intellectual property rights must agree to use of their intellectual property free of charge in a GPL (v3 or later) licensed project including PUMA. Any other licensed intellectual property in a submission must be under a type of license that allows the contributor(s) to use those materials in any videos, documents or models they submit and allow them also to be used free of charge under the GPL license used by the PUMA repositorty. Any attributions required for such use must be made correctly by the contributor in their submission.
By making a submission of material to the PUMA repository by pull-request or other means, the submitter agrees to the above conditions.

## Logos, Branding and Trade Marks
No trade marks or brand logos are to be part of any submitted materials (apart from those present on components that need to be purchased).
